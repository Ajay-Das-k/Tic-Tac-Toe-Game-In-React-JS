# Getting Started with Create React App
Tic Tac Toe is a classic two-player game where each player takes turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid. The objective of the game is to get three of your marks (either X or O) in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row.

In this React implementation of Tic Tac Toe:

Game Interface: The game provides a simple and intuitive interface with a 3x3 grid of squares where players can make their moves.

Player Turns: The game alternates between two players, usually represented by X and O. Players take turns clicking on empty squares to place their marks.

Winning Condition: The game checks after each move if there is a winner. A player wins if they have three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally). If there are no more empty squares and no winner, the game ends in a draw.

Reset Functionality: There is a "Reset" button that allows players to start a new game at any time. Clicking the "Reset" button clears the grid and resets the game state.

Feedback and Alerts: The game provides feedback to the players when there is a winner or a draw. It uses a SweetAlert modal to display a message when the game is over, informing the players of the result (win or draw).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
